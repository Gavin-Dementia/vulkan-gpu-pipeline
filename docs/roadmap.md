# Renderer Roadmap

This document tracks the planned development stages of the project,
updated against what was actually built (vs. originally planned).

---

## Phase 0 — Vulkan Bootstrap

**Status: Complete**

Implemented:
- GLFW window
- Vulkan instance
- Validation layers
- Surface creation
- Physical device selection
- Logical device creation
- Swapchain creation

---

## Phase 1 — Frame Presentation

**Status: Complete**

Implemented:
- Command Pool
- Command Buffer (double-buffered, 2 frames in flight)
- Fence / Semaphore (per-frame + per-swapchain-image)
- Acquire / Submit / Present

Milestone reached: first presented frame (solid color clear).

---

## Phase 2 — First Triangle

**Status: Complete**

Implemented:
- Render Pass (later extended with a depth attachment — see Phase 3)
- Framebuffer
- Graphics Pipeline
- Shader Modules

Milestone reached: hardcoded triangle, color from fragment shader.

---

## Phase 3 — Mesh Rendering

**Status: Complete — exceeded original scope**

Originally planned: Vertex Buffer, Index Buffer, Uniform Buffer,
Descriptor Sets.

Actually implemented:
- Vertex Buffer (staging → DEVICE_LOCAL transfer)
- Index Buffer with vertex deduplication (OBJ loader: 2904 → 507 unique
  vertices for Suzanne)
- Uniform Buffer (MVP matrix, HOST_VISIBLE — written every frame, no
  staging; see `TECHNICAL_NOTES.md` §3 for why this differs from
  vertex/index buffer handling)
- Descriptor Sets (graphics: 1 binding; later compute: 4 bindings)
- Depth Buffer (`D32_SFLOAT`, not originally scoped for this phase but
  pulled in early since it was needed before instancing made draw order
  ambiguous)
- Normal-based fragment shading (to visually confirm depth testing was
  actually working, not just present)

Milestone reached: real OBJ mesh (Suzanne) rendered with correct depth
ordering and per-fragment normal coloring.

---

## Phase 4 — Scene Framework

**Status: Partially complete, descoped in favor of Phase 5**

Originally planned: Camera, Transform, Material, Scene Graph.

Actually implemented:
- Camera (first-person, WASD + QE + arrow keys, shared view matrix
  between culling and rendering)
- Transform: handled inline via per-instance position data rather than
  a general Transform component (no rotation/scale per-instance yet —
  all instances share the model matrix's rotation)

Not implemented: Material abstraction, general Scene Graph. Decision was
to prioritize the GPU-driven culling core (Phase 5) over generalizing
the scene representation, since culling was the project's actual stated
goal and a full scene graph wasn't a prerequisite for it.

---

## Phase 5 — GPU-Driven Rendering

**Status: Complete — exceeded original scope**

Originally planned: Storage Buffers, Indirect Draw, Compute-driven
visibility.

Actually implemented:
- Storage Buffers (`ObjectBuffer`, `VisibleInstanceBuffer`,
  `IndirectDrawBuffer` — all SSBOs)
- Compute-driven visibility: sphere-vs-frustum test (Gribb-Hartmann
  plane extraction from the view-projection matrix), 64 threads/workgroup
- **Atomic compaction** — not originally scoped, but turned out to be
  the actual mechanism that makes this GPU-driven rather than GPU-
  assisted. A naive 0/1 visibility array still requires the CPU to read
  results back and decide a draw count; atomic compaction lets passing
  threads claim output slots directly, so the GPU itself determines and
  writes the final instance count. See `TECHNICAL_NOTES.md` §7.
- Indirect Draw (`vkCmdDrawIndexedIndirect`) — CPU never reads culling
  results back
- FrameGraph extended to support Compute and Graphics passes as distinct
  stages within the same DAG, rather than special-casing compute outside
  the dependency graph (`TECHNICAL_NOTES.md` §4)
- 343-instance grid (7×7×7) to make culling behavior visually legible
- Experimentally validated: oscillating a test object's position with
  `sin(time)` produced matching `1 → 0 → 1` visibility transitions in
  sync, confirming the culling logic is functionally correct rather than
  coincidentally always passing

Milestone reached: GPU-driven culling pipeline, interactively verifiable
via camera movement (instances visibly appear/disappear as the frustum
moves).

---

## Open / not yet started

- **Texture sampling** — deprioritized in favor of finishing the
  GPU-driven culling core first
- **LOD (level of detail)** — natural extension of the existing compute
  pass; object buffer already has per-instance distance-computable data
- **Performance instrumentation** — GPU timestamp queries to quantify
  culling's actual frame-time impact (currently demonstrated
  functionally, not yet measured numerically)
- **PBR material model**
- **Multi-pass / hierarchical culling** — current design is a flat
  343-thread scan; fine at this scale, would need a coarser first pass
  at much higher instance counts

---

## Long-term goals

- Modern Vulkan architecture (in progress, core patterns established)
- GPU-driven rendering research direction (demonstrated with working
  culling pipeline; candidate next steps: LOD, neural-rendering hybrid
  approaches under consideration for graduate study direction)
- Foundation for future rendering experiments
